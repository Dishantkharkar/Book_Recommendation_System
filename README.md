## Introduction

The Book Recommender System is built using collaborative filtering techniques that analyze user behaviour and patterns to recommend books. It leverages data on user interactions with books, such as ratings and reviews, to make personalized suggestions. The goal is to provide users with tailored book recommendations that match their tastes and preferences, leading to a more satisfying reading experience.

## How It Works

The recommender system is built on a collaborative filtering algorithm, which has two main components:

1. **User-User Collaborative Filtering:** This method recommends books based on the preferences of similar users. It identifies users who have similar reading habits, and if a user has read or liked books that another similar user has enjoyed, the system will recommend those unread books to the first user.

2. **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering:** This approach recommends books by finding similarities between items (books). It identifies books that are similar to the ones a user has already read or liked. If a user has enjoyed certain books, the system will suggest other books that share similar characteristics or are commonly liked by users who have also enjoyed the original books.

## Installation

To use the Book Recommender System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dishantkharkar/Book_Recommendation_System.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd Book_Recommendation_System
```

3. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the Book Recommender System, you need to provide the necessary data in the required format. The data should include information on user interactions with books, such as user IDs, book IDs, ratings, and reviews. You can either use your own data or explore publicly available datasets related to books and user interactions.

Once you have the data, follow these steps:

1. Preprocess the data: Prepare the data in a format suitable for the recommender system. The data should be organized in a way that captures user-item interactions.

2. Train the model: Use the provided scripts to train the collaborative filtering algorithm on your preprocessed data.

3. Get recommendations: Once the model is trained, you can obtain book recommendations for specific users by running the relevant scripts.

4. Evaluate the system: Measure the performance of the Book Recommender System using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its effectiveness.

## Data

The repository does not include any specific dataset. You can use your own data or explore publicly available datasets related to books and user interactions. Make sure to format the data properly for the recommender system to work effectively.
